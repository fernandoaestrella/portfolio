[Skunworks Course Scheduler](https://github.com/brandeis-skunkworks/course-scheduling/tree/master/Vagrant)

My contributions:

[Front End communicating with Back End](https://github.com/brandeis-skunkworks/course-scheduling/blob/manual-scheduling-front-end/scheduling-app/src/App.js)

[Back End communicating with Front End](https://github.com/brandeis-skunkworks/course-scheduling/blob/manual-scheduling-front-end/api/app.js)

I lead the team to develop the back end pages displayed below. I am coding the Back End so that a Node.js server connects with the database and communicates with a server running React to handle the Front End.

[Facebook Post Generator](https://github.com/fernandoaestrella/nlp-final-project)

Natural Language Processing project done as a team where we applied Machine Learning to determine the sentiment a given article might carry and then created a possible response someone could have to it.

My contributions:

Mainly adapted base sentiment analysis code to work with the possible input articles we would be receiving. Found here: [Testing diverse classifier models](https://github.com/fernandoaestrella/nlp-final-project/blob/master/all_together_e.py).

[RoboCup Agent in C Sharp](https://github.com/fernandoaestrella/RoboCup-Agent-in-CSharp)

Robocup 2D is a worlwide competition that pits teams of AI writers to create the brains of a robotic agent playing soccer.

This was a proyect we started in college to practice UDP connections and AI. This one specifically only starts a connection with the server, starts a player, interprets the whole received string (only the "see" string), determines the position of the player with a simple method based on the closest flag and knowledge of its position, and with that information either moves to a desired position, waits for an amount of time determined by the user, and asks for another position, or closes in on the ball and kicks it to the goal (assuming they were both being seen).

My contributions:

Aproximately the later half of the code located here: [Program.cs](https://github.com/fernandoaestrella/RoboCup-Agent-in-CSharp/blob/master/RoboCup%20Agent/RoboCup%20Agent/Program.cs)

We did not create the graphical simulation shown below. It is used to visualize the behavior of the simulation.

### Games

---

[SlideIn](https://github.com/fernandoaestrella/SlideIn)

A game in which you summon units in a table top gameboard. The goal is to slide your units into the opponent's goal tile. You can also remove a unit by placing yours in a specific way.

My contributions:

All code written by me.

To play:

Go to [SlideIn.exe](https://github.com/fernandoaestrella/SlideIn/blob/master/SlideIn.exe), download and run it.

To see code:

Go to [Assets](https://github.com/fernandoaestrella/SlideIn/tree/master/Assets) and look at the C Sharp files.

[Improved Pong](http://example.com/)

Some improvements made to a Pong/Break Out basic game idea like:
- Ability to shoot multiple shots
- Paddle freezes for some time when hitting the ball
- Paddle gets smaller after every hit
- Shot accelerates or slows ball depending on whether the ball was approaching or going away
- Score per time calculation
- Ball accelerates after hitting paddle
- Ball goes redder the faster it goes
